# Destiny Chip

It's a 🥚 shell project in the hope of raising a chip of fate☘

The above are all Adolescent Delusions statements😉.

This is a hands-on project, she will help me get familiar with the process of real project development, and the integration of various technology stacks.

She was born out of the atguigu.com's Crowdfunding Network project. 

She is still an unfinished project, and I will work on her over the next few days. 

Hopefully🍀, I can reach my goal!

My English is not very good, so I may have some problems expressing myself, please forgive me😅!

If there are any problems, I hope you can dispute my mistake😀!
